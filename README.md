## Project Overview

This project is an application that uses APIs to generate a creative Hello World message. I have used OpenAI's GPT API and selected the gpt-4o-mini model. It makes a basic call to the API and displays the result in console. To make the response creative, I have prompted the system to converse like Professor Dumbledore from Harry Potter. I have loaded my API key from a `.env` file to maintain security.
